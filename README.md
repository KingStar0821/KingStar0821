ðŸ‘‹ Hi
As one of numerous app developers, I love web.
When I wasðŸŒ±five, I saw my first computerâ€”a Pentium3ðŸ‘€and it blew my mind. Up until then, Iâ€™d only known TV, but this was something else entirely.
It felt like a machine from the future, and I was immediately drawn in, even if I didnâ€™t fully understand it yet.
As aðŸ˜„kid, though, I mostly used computers for one thing: playing a wonderful electronic game with my friends.
We were absolutely hooked and would spend hours on it, totally convinced that this was what computers were made for.
But over time, I started seeing computers differently.âš¡
I realized they were so much more than gamesâ€”they were powerful tools, capable of transforming the world.
And then I recognized the internet is the best creative of human, and that changed everything for me. I wanted in.
So, I threw myself into learning how to develop apps. It took years of hard work, but by the time I was 24, Iâ€™d made it to senior developer.
Looking back now, Iâ€™m grateful for that decisionâ€”and excited about where itâ€™ll take me next.
